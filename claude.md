# Claude Code Guidelines

## Git Commit Practices

- Make atomic commits: each commit should represent a single logical change
- Commit frequently as work progresses rather than batching at the end
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages focusing on the "why"
- Do not include co-author attributions in commits
